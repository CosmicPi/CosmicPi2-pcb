# CosmicPiV2.0b
Version 2, beta production of the Cosmic Pi, learning the lessons from V2.0alpha and adding back the UART connection between GPS and STM32. All the components are now on a single PCB with a snap-off for the SiPM elements. SiPMs are now from Broadcom, as they purchased Ketek's SiPM production unit.

The design uses scintillators from Amcrys http://www.amcrys.com/ which are not yet available via a retail outlet, however any BC-408 equivalent scintillator that has diamond polished finish surfaces and dimensions of 200x100x10mm can be mated to the SiPMs with suitable mounting holes.
